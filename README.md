# Saatva News

Saatva News is powered by React and Express. It uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management, [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for custom styles, [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) for rapid prototyping, [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://www.chaijs.com/) for testing, and [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for http requests. It runs on Node v8.9.4. 

If your machine is running a different version, [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is a good utility that manages Node versions and might be useful. 

To start Saatva News locally, run the following:
```
npm i # install dependencies

npm run build # build the bundle

npm start # start the server

npm test # in another window
```
